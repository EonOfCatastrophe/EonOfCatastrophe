Hello, mate!
For starters, I'm a pretty nice guy, but of course everyone has their own set of boundaries. I'm usually active on PT but commonly semi-afk. Sometimes trolling people or messing around.

You can approach me anytime, though I suggest whispering. (I'd miss out on the actual message.) 

Any form of interaction is alright! But kindly refrain from kissing and cuddling. Not too comfortable with it even for friends.
