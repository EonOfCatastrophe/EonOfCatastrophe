Hello, mate!
For starters, I'm a pretty nice or chill guy, but of course everyone has their own set of boundaries. I'm usually active on PT but often off-tab or afk. Sometimes trolling people or messing around.

You can approach me anytime, although I suggest whispering. (I'd miss out on the actual message.) Like in the bio, Away means I'm off-tab, afk, or in a (zoom) meeting. Busy, either whispering someone or semi-afk.

Any form of interaction is alright! But kindly refrain from kissing.

I'm perfectly alright with homophobes or open LGBTQ+ as long as you don't force your opinions.
We all have our own opinions in things! So let's keep our conversations chill and civilized.
