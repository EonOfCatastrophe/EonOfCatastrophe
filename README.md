Hello, mate! Call me Toast. (Or pony names if you prefer them)

For starters, I'm a pretty nice guy, but of course everyone has their own set of boundaries. I'm usually active on PT but often semi-afk. Though, possibly messing around.

You can approach me, though I suggest whispering. I'd miss out on the actual message.

Any form of interaction is okay, but kindly refrain from kissing and cuddling. Not too comfortable with it, even with friends.
